# Grails Quickstart
> A simple auto-generated Grails app

This doesn't do much so just serves as a reference for myself on how a Grails app is setup.


## Sample

## About

This project was created with Grails Application Forge service.

- http://start.grails.org/

The service lets you download a zip file with the Generate button or a curl command (using your app name). The default settings were used - a web app and the latest Grails.

```sh
$ curl -O start.grails.org/grailsQuickstart.zip -d version=4.0.3
```

The app was nammed `grailsQuickstart` so the name `grailsquickstart` now appears in part of the code.

For a more detailed guide, see [Creating your first Grails app](https://guides.grails.org/creating-your-first-grails-app/guide/index.html) in the Grails docs.
