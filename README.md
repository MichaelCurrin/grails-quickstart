# Grails Quickstart
> A simple auto-generated Grails app

This doesn't do much so just serves as a reference for myself on how a Grails app is setup.


## About

This project was created with Grails Application Forge service.

- http://start.grails.org/

The default settings were used.

The service lets you download a zip file with the Generate button or a curl command (using your app name).

```sh
$ curl -O start.grails.org/grailsQuickstart.zip -d version=4.0.3
```


## Requirements

- [Java](https://java.com)
